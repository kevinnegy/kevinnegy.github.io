<h2>How to Email Professors</h2>
<p2> There are many situations when it is necessary to email professors:<br /><br />
• Asking for letters of recommendation<br />
• Asking to get involved in research<br />
• Asking potential advisers at other universities to meet with you<br />
• Post-visit thank you emails<br />
• Asking a professor to modify an existing letter of recommendation</p2><br />
<p2> As simple as writing an email sounds, I have learned that there is a subtle strategy that comes with crafting emails to professors. It involves carefully choosing words and phrases in a diplomatic way. These emails are mini-persuasive essays. I have included an email that I sent to a professor asking for a letter of recommendation to use as a way to discuss the components of a successful email. I have removed any personal information about professors for their privacy. </p2>
<br /><br /><br /> <br />

<p3> Start with "Dear Dr. ______," or "Hello Dr. _____," unless they have told you to call them something else. </p3> <br />
<p3> 1) Since I have already met this professor, this sentence serves as a transition and a friendly greeting. Other appropriate greeting sentences include, "Hope you had a nice winter break," or "Hope you are doing well." If I had not introduced myself, I would have started with "My name is Kevin Negy. I am (description of who I am)." </p3> <br />
<p3> 2) I am immediately getting to the point: I have a favor to ask. Always try to get to the point quickly. </p3> <br />
<p3> 3) I make the request. Phrasing requests directly as questions with question marks sound more confident and make it more likely that a professor will respond. Compare my request to a more timid, indirect question: "I was hoping you would write me a letter of recommendation..." </p3> <br />
<p3> 4) I provide extra details to help persuade the professor. </p3> <br />
<p3> 5) I next include a brief highlight reel of relevant information to help the professor decide. </p3> <br />
<p3> 6) I include relevant attachments with more information that can help with the request. </p3> <br />
<p3> 7) I reiterate my request in direct question format. </p3> <br />
<p3> Finish with a polite closing phrase and then your name. </p3> <br />



<br /><br /> 
<p2> Keys to remember when emailing professors no matter what the request: </p2><br />
<p2> - Get to the point early. </p2>
<p2> - Be concise. </p2>
<p2> - Be polite. </p2>
<p2> - Ask direct questions. </p2> 
<p2> - Break up emails into short paragraphs. </p2>
